# Python implementation

## How to run code

Under terminal with the proper directory: `$ python3 main.py` 
    Example output: `There are 2 captured angles: [56.3, 284.0]`

One may modify the driver code `main.py` to test out different scenarios. Namely, modify the three user input.

## How to test implementation

I used `unittest` library and wrote over 10 test cases. 

Under terminal with the proper directory: `$ python3 test_gimbal_steering.py`
    Example output: 
    ``` ...........
        ----------------------------------------------------------------------
        Ran 11 tests in 0.001s

        OK 
    ```

One may add more test cases to efficiently test the implementation.
